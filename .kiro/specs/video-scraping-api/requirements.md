# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a new FastAPI endpoint that can process a single video by downloading it and segmenting it based on transcript data containing timestamps and knowledge points. The API will integrate with the existing FastAPI architecture and follow established patterns for consistent behavior across the codebase.

The feature builds upon the existing `backend/core/plan/scraping` module's media downloading capabilities, but focuses specifically on single video processing workflows for educational content segmentation based on knowledge points and timestamps.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content processor, I want to provide a video URL and transcript data with timestamps and knowledge points, so that the system can download the video and segment it according to the knowledge points for subsequent analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request to `/api/v1/videos/process` with a video URL and transcript data THEN the system SHALL download the video and validate its accessibility
2. WHEN the video is downloaded THEN the system SHALL parse the transcript data to extract time ranges for each knowledge point
3. WHEN time ranges are identified THEN the system SHALL segment the video using ffmpeg or similar tool based on the timestamps
4. WHEN segmentation completes THEN the system SHALL return metadata about each segment including file paths, knowledge point information, and duration
5. IF the video URL is inaccessible or invalid THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
6. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide status updates via polling endpoint

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want to configure processing parameters such as output format, quality settings, and segment naming conventions, so that I can optimize the video processing for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I include processing options in the API request THEN the system SHALL respect the specified parameters for output format, quality, and segment organization
2. WHEN I specify output directory preferences THEN the system SHALL organize segmented files in the requested structure
3. WHEN I set timeout values THEN the system SHALL abort processing that exceeds the specified time limits
4. IF I don't specify processing options THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for video quality and output format
5. WHEN I specify unsupported video formats THEN the system SHALL attempt conversion or return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the video processing pipeline and handle errors gracefully, so that I can ensure reliable operation and troubleshoot issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video processing fails due to network or system issues THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with appropriate backoff
2. WHEN storage space is insufficient THEN the system SHALL check disk space before starting processing and return appropriate errors
3. WHEN the video service encounters protected or authentication-required content THEN the system SHALL log warnings and return meaningful error messages
4. WHEN processing is cancelled or interrupted THEN the system SHALL clean up partial files and update job status appropriately
5. WHEN multiple processing requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them as background jobs to prevent resource exhaustion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content processor, I want to track the progress of video processing and receive detailed metadata about each video segment, so that I can monitor the process and use the segment information for subsequent analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request processing status THEN the system SHALL provide current progress including download progress, segmentation progress, and ETA
2. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL return metadata for each segment including knowledge point, time range, file path, and duration
3. WHEN I query active processing jobs THEN the system SHALL return the current status and progress information
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and failure reasons
5. WHEN I request processing history THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on successful/failed jobs and performance metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the video processing endpoint to follow the same patterns as other FastAPI endpoints in the codebase, so that I have a consistent integration experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the API THEN it SHALL follow the same response format patterns as existing endpoints with success/error status and consistent error handling
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use the same authentication mechanisms as other protected endpoints
3. WHEN I make requests THEN the system SHALL apply the same CORS, timeout, and middleware configurations as other API routes
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use the same exception handling patterns and return structured error responses
5. WHEN I access API documentation THEN the endpoint SHALL be properly documented in the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the video processing to handle various video platforms and formats intelligently, so that I can process content from different sources without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide YouTube, Vimeo, or other platform video URLs THEN the system SHALL download them using appropriate methods (youtube-dl, direct download, etc.)
2. WHEN I provide direct video file URLs (MP4, WebM, etc.) THEN the system SHALL download them directly
3. WHEN video URLs require special handling THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate downloader automatically
4. WHEN the video format is not directly supported by ffmpeg THEN the system SHALL attempt format conversion before segmentation
5. WHEN transcript timestamps don't align perfectly with video duration THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases gracefully
